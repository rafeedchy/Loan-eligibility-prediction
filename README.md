# Loan-eligibility-prediction

In this project I took the dataset, preprocessed it with missing values, categorical feature conversion to numerical numbers and data with multiple values had to be label encoded with the help of sklearn preprocessing. 
I used visualization to find key insights. Here We can see that people with low income tend to apply for loan more. However, Higher income people tries to get high amount of loans. With heatmap we can see that LoanAmount and ApplicantIncome has positive correlation. 
Finally, I used logistic regression model to predict the test dataset. I got the accuracy for this model 0.80
